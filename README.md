# ESGApplication
Application written as part of the recruitment process for ESG.

We will need a new Java app to read in a CSV file from a directory. The contents will then need to be sent to a REST API endpoint, in JSON format, and saved to a SQL database.

1. Create a console app to read in a CSV file from a directory.

2. Parse the CSV file of which the contents are:

- Customer Ref
- Customer Name
- Address Line 1
- Address Line 2
- Town
- County
- Country
- Postcode

3. Loop through the rows of the CSV file and send each row to a REST API POST endpoint, in JSON format.

4. The REST API should then save the content to a database table. Format can match the CSV file.

5. Create a REST API GET endpoint to retrieve the customer information, passing in a customer ref to filter the data. Contents should be returned in JSON format.

6. Some documentation or Wiki to explain the approach taken.

Where possible, a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach should be taken.

# Approach taken

I have created this as a Spring boot application.

- First, I have been thinking about the CSV reader which will need to parse a CSV file and then send the rows to a POST endpoint. So working backwards, I have created the POST endpoint first with a service and repository behind it. Created an integration test using MockMVC and a H2 database to test the creation of a Customer.
